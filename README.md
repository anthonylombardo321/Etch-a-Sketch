This project (from the Odin Project) further reinforced everything I learned so far, regarding HTML, CSS, and JS. Through this project, I learned more about event listeners and how to create and manipulate a grid using CSS and JS, in order to recreate the iconic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Just pass your mouse over the grid and release your inner child. Have fun!
